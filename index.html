    <p>
     Happiest Birthdayyyy Adithyannn!!
      You dont even know how important you are for me.<br><br>
      Thank you for always showing up for the deep talks, the laughs, and the quiet support when I need it most.
      Thank you for always being there for me and i'll try my best to be there for you whenever you need me.
      Thank you for understanding my silence, me when i needed space and showing me what a true friend is.
      You're a true Gym guy on the outside, solid gold pookie human on the inside.<br>
      I’m really grateful to have you in my life you're my safe space and thank you soooo much for being that when i needed someone.
      Hope this year gives back over and above of what you give to everyone around you (especially me).<br><br>
      Happy Birthday to someone who lifts heavy, cares deeply, and somehow does both effortlessly.
      Ive so much to say but no words to express the bond we have but i hope i never lose this :))<br><br>
      I wanted to try something new for you so that its special so i made a website for your birthday, its not much but well i tried :3
      Old as you get our bond only strengthens and i will do my best to keep it that way so that we never fade away from each others lives and one day
      when we meet we do all the things we've always been excited to do together.<br>
      You’re very thoughtful, kind, strong and a man(doesnt mean i wont hold you in your weak moments, always will have a shoulder and a ear to lend for you) 
      and way more emotionally intelligent than you let on and thats what makes you special.
      Your good characteristics erase or makes a person forget your flaws (not that you have any :3)<br><br>
      Nee enikku bayankara precious aanu (I hope this is right)<br><br>
      LOVE YAAAA✨💜<br><br>
      From yours truly
      Janu💗
